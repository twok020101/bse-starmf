## Introduction to the WEB Services API Structure Document

BSE StAR MF Mutual Fund Platform provides Web Services based Order routing services and Additional
Services for all Mutual Fund Intermediaries (MFIs)/Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs) / Vendors / Application
Solution Providers (ASP Vendors) using third party vendor solutions and/or in-house developed trading
applications over the Internet

### Going Live of your software for the BSE Mutual fund Segment

The following steps are needed to be taken.

1. Member can receive the API documents and request for Test Market credentials by sending mail
    with their existing Live BSE StAR MF Member ID.
2. Develop your own software using the BSE StAR MF Test Market.
3. Once ready request the Exchange for a demo of the product to be conducted in the Test Market.
4. Once Demo is given and product is confirmed member shall receive the Live API links.
5. Member can integrate the Live API links within their product and go live.

### Pre-Requisites

#### Infrastructure

The BSE StAR MF Webservices is used over the Internet to connect from the Member/ Vendor Server to the
BSE StAR MF server. Members /Vendors can utilize their existing Internet Connectivity for using the
Webservices, however It is recommended to have dedicated bandwidth and low latency connectivity.

#### Software

Any language that has support for a SOAP based Library (SOAP Ver 1.2) can be used in development for using
the Web Services API.

#### Access to Test Environment

BSE Provides a Test Environment to its members for testing, development and Integration of their Products
using the BSE StAR MF Web Services API. If the Member/Vendor desires access for the same, he can send a
mail requesting access to navaneetha.krishnan@bsetech.in or aqsa.shaikh@bsetech.in with his BSE StAR MF
Member ID.

#### Testing Tools

It is recommended to use SOAPUI (Open-Source Version) available at https://www.soapui.org/ for testing
the Web Services API. It is also possible to use POSTMAN for testing however it will require manual crafting
of the XML SOAP requests which is done automatically by SOAPUI.

#### Web Services APIs

The WEB SERVICE API is an ASP.NET XML based service using SOAP which is language agnostic and can be
called by any language having SOAP 1.2 libraries.


## Understanding the Web Service API

- All Web Services are separated in their own sections based on their own Authentication mechanism.
- All APIs require a Session ID /Encrypted Password to be generated by the Authentication method
    before calling the actual API eg. getPassword method for Order API
- Each Section has the API web service link for the API provided in the Introduction or start of the
    sections.
- For each web service on opening the API Link Members are given two links for WSDL definition,
    Members have to use the ?singleWsdl link to generate the Methods for their language if required
    eg. .NET, Java etc..
- Please use the /Secure Endpoint as given in the WSDL definition for all communication as it uses
    HTTPS.
- If you are using a SOAP library to connect to the Web Service kindly ensure that you are targeting
    the correct Service and the HTTPS endpoint (/Secure) eg given in the Web Service ?singleWsdl
    configuration. In this case ‘MFOrder’ and ‘ WSHttpBinding_MFOrderEntry1’
- All API Table Descriptions are given in the same order as the module definitions given in the WSDL
    method for the given API
- Methods are given along with the API Structure with the snapshot of the relevant in the API Sample
    requests and Response are provided in the Member


## Common Fields and Nomenclature used in the Web Service API

#### User ID:

Login ID/ User ID /Web Service ID is the Main ID which is used for Login along with the Member ID. This is
provided by the Exchange for the API.

#### Member ID:

Member ID/ Member Code is assigned to the member on registration with the Exchange. This is not the
ARN Code.

#### Password:

The Password which is provided for User ID/ Login ID.

#### Passkey:

The Passkey is an random Alphanumeric string used to increase the session Entropy when creating the
Encrypted Password / Session ID

#### Client Code:

The Client for which the transaction or service has to be invoked.

#### getPassword:

The Authentication method that is used to establish a session for the additional requests. The validity for
the Encrypted Password /Session ID generated is 1 hour for MFOrder.svc and 5 minutes for the rest.

_Note: This is not required in methods in which authentication is built-in_

#### Encrypted Password

This is the session ID to be used after being generated through the getPassword method to authenticate
the session.
